        <h2>About FTC Power Play</h2>
        <p>
            For my involvement in the First Tech Challenge (FTC) Power Play, I led the development of Java programs for both the autonomous and manual sections of the challenge. These programs played a crucial role in the successful execution of our team's robot during competitions.
        </p>
        <p>
            The autonomous programs were designed to make the robot perform predefined tasks without direct human control, showcasing precision and efficiency. The manual control programs allowed our team to operate the robot seamlessly during teleoperated periods, contributing to our overall strategy and performance.
        </p>
        <p>
            The codebase for this project is available on <a href="https://github.com/justinv1234/FTCPowerPlay" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.

        <h2>Project Impact</h2>
        <p>
            The programs that I have created had a direct impact on our team's success in competitions. Through the development of efficient and reliable Java programs, our robot consistently performed well in both autonomous and manual modes, contributing to our overall achievements.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Autonomous:</b> By incorporating the OpenCV library into our robot, we are able to use real-time optimized computer vision to automatically detect april tags and move to a designated space.

        <h2>Continuous Learning</h2>
        <p>
            Working on FTC Power Play provided opportunities for continuous learning. I expanded my knowledge in external java libraries and gained practical experience in applying these concepts to real-world challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am committed to ongoing learning and staying updated with emerging technologies in the field of robotics and programming.

        <p>
            The video below demonstrates the autonomous script. By incorporating OpenCV into our robot (The bottom left robot) we were able to make it detect where to go and move accordingly.
