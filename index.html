                <h3>FTC Power Play - Java Programming</h3>
                <p>
                    For my involvement in the First Tech Challenge (FTC) Power Play, I led the development of Java programs for both the autonomous and manual sections of the challenge. These programs played a crucial role in the successful execution of our team's robot during competitions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The autonomous programs were designed to make the robot perform predefined tasks without direct human control, showcasing precision and efficiency. The manual control programs allowed our team to operate the robot seamlessly during teleoperated periods, contributing to our overall strategy and performance.
                </p>
